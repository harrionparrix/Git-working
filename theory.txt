4 stages of git:

Untracked: just adding the files, git doesnt care.  
Unmodified: commited file are here, fi we change go to modify
Modified: modified code which goes to stage
Staged: staging area contains files that are to be commited. 

Untracked -> Staged ->(commit) -> Unmodified ->(modify the code)-> Modified -> (commit) ->Staged

Ex.  1.html, 2 3 4 

If i wanna work more on 3 4, then we stage 1 and 2 only.
Now after Staging, git records the file
file now is unmodified.
if we modify, its modified.
then stage again, then modify again.

Steps:

open folder

code . (vs)

git init (adds git to folder)

git status 

git add x.html/whatever
git add -A (adding multiple files)

git commit
(i , insert text, esc , :wq)

easier : git commit -m "Added/changed files, text to write"
git commit -a -m  (fully skips staging area and commits directly)

git status

to recover:::
git checkout first.html
git checkout -f  (for all)


git log (all info)
last few commits:
git log -p  -1


git diff(tells the difference between working tree and staging area)
git diff --staged (compares last commit and staged area)

ls (show files)

git rm waste.html(removes the file) 
git rm --cached waste.html (removes from staging area)

git status -s 
summarised status

first M: modified in staging area
second M: modified in working tree


*git ignore 
touch .gitignore

if wanna ignore all log type files/c++ files or any files
*.log in gitignore
*.cpp in gitignore

ignore a folder :    foldername/ in gitignore



branches:
copy of the original master 
git branch BRANCH_NAME

git checkout Branch_name

git merge feature1

git checkout -b branchname
